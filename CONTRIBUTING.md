## Building

[See the
documentation](http://discourse.syncthing.net/t/building-syncthing/44)

## Branches

 - `master` is the main branch containing good code that will end up in
   the next release. You should base your work on it. It won't ever be
   rebased or force-pushed to.

 - `vx.y` branches exist to make patch releases on otherwise obsolete
   minor releases. Should only contain fixes cherry picked from master.
   Don't base any work on them.

 - Other branches are probably topic branches and may be subject to
   rebasing. Don't base any work on them unless you specifically know
   otherwise.

## Tags
